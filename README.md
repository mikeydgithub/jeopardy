  ## Story

  As a game developer I want to see the basics of object orientated programming
  
  So that when I play Jeoprady
  
  I can click a card
  
  And see a question with 2 responsones
  
  Only one response is correct
  
  Then based on your answer
  
  Your score will increase if correct and stay still if incorrect
